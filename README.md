# Executive Summary
 
## Project Overview  
The high rate of customers leaving banks (churn rate) suggests deficiencies in several areas, including customer experience, operational efficiency, and the competitiveness of products and features. This necessitates a focus on understanding and managing customer churn to improve overall customer satisfaction and achieve sustainable growth.

------ A project overview should be a few sentences long stating the problem you solved, what data was used in the project, and your modeling results.

## Business Objective
If a customer churns, it means they left the bank and took their business elsewhere. If you can predict which customers are likely to churn, you can take measures to retain them before they do.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
Explain what data you used in your analysis, the timeframe of the data, and any data limitations. This is also a good section to add visualizations of your exploratory data analysis.
## Feature Engineering

## Modeling and Evaluation
This section should detail what models you used and the corresponding evaluation metrics.
## Conclusion
In the conclusion section explain the recommendations you have in solving the business problem and highlight any future steps you will take to expand on your project,
