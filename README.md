## Problem Statement
Banks face a significant challenge in retaining customers, as customer churn can lead to substantial financial losses and hinder business growth. Identifying customers at risk of churning is crucial for banks to implement proactive retention strategies and maintain customer loyalty. Churn can result in lost revenue, increased acquisition costs, damaged reputation, reduced market share, and operational inefficiencies.

## Objective
Investigate data to discover patterns and develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting customer churn. This model will serve as a valuable tool for marketing analysts to identify at-risk customers, enabling them to design targeted retention campaigns and optimize marketing budgets for maximum impact.

## Methodology


### Data Source
This customer churn dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers) contains information for 10K bank customers with 14 features describing their demographics, account details, banking activity and churn status, making it directly relevant for predicting customer churn.

There are two main types of features: numeric and categorical
- 7 numeric features: RowNumber, CustomerId ,CreditScore, Age, Tenure, Balance, EstimatedSalary
- 7 categorical features: Surname, Gender, Geography, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, Exited


### Data Preprocessing ##########################

#### Dropping features
  - The **CustomerId** and **Surname** variable has sensitive customer data and should be removed to maintain confidentally. 
  - **Gender** should also be removed as it would be discrimatory to offer promotions based on gender.
  - **RowNumber** can also be removed has it is just a counter.
  - 
The new shape after dropping these features are (10000,10). 


### Modeling Techniques
The objective is to build a model that predict whether a customer is likely to churn by training various classification models, including decision tree, random forest, and xgboost, on the training data. The model with the best performance will be chosen as the winner. This winning model will then be used to predict churn on new, unseen data.

### Evaluation Metric
In predicting customer churn, the model can make two types of mistakes:

- **False positive**: The model predicts a customer will leave (churn) but they stay. This might lead to unnecessary efforts to retain the customer.
- **False negative**: The model predicts a customer will stay but they end up leaving. This can be more costly, as the bank misses the chance to intervene.
  
Since it's more critical to avoid missing churned customers, focusing on recall (catching churners) seems ideal. However, prioritizing recall alone could lead the model to mistakenly predict churn for many customers who wouldn't actually leave. This would result in the bank wasting resources on unnecessary customer retention efforts.

To strike a balance, the **F1 score** is a better metric to use. It considers both recall and precision (correctly identifying non-churners), giving a more accurate picture of the model's performance. 

## Results and Insights

### Model Results: 

<img src="https://github.com/aprilhong/bankchurn/assets/78663820/f388a624-60d6-4e25-bb74-11b3d0a976a9" width="400">

The F1 scores from all models are ranked in descending order and the the XGBoost score on the test data ranks the highest at 0.77, indicating a strong balance between precision and recall. Compared to the F1 scores of 0.56 and 0.61, this is a significant improvement. It suggests that tuning the decision tree and exploring other algorithms/features, have been effective.

# Key Insights: 
Of 10,000 bank customers, 2037 customers churn leading to total of $185M loss in balance. 
- Age: 60% ($111M) are due to customers between 40-60 age bracket, which average churn rate of 40%
- Geography: Customers who churned in Germany had significantly higher average balances ($120,000) compared to France ($71,000) and Spain ($73,000). Germany also has the highest churn rate (32%), suggesting that a higher proportion of customers with larger balances are leaving the company in Germany, potentially impacting revenue.
- Tenure: Customers under 70 are more likely to churn within the first five years of service.
- Number of Products: Customers with a single product have the highest churn rate (50.84%), while those with two products have the lowest churn rate (45.9%). Almost all customers with 3 or more products have churned. 
- Active Members: Inactive customers have a significantly higher churn rate (26.9%) compared to active customers (14.3%).

# Recommendations

## For Marketing Analyst
From the data analysis, Germany is losing a higher proportion of customers with larger balances. Further investigation into the reasons behind churn in Germany might be beneficial to mitigate customer losses and the associated revenue impact.

A quarter of lost customers had no account balance, suggesting they might not have been actively using our services. The bank can explore following actions. 
  - Bundled Packages: Create package deals that offer multiple products at a discounted rate, encouraging them to explore different services.
  - Re-Engagement Campaigns: Reach out to inactive accounts with targeted email or mobile notifications. Offer incentives for re-activation, like account bonuses or discounts on financial products.
  - Identify Reasons for Inactivity: Conduct surveys or polls to understand why accounts become inactive. This can help address underlying issues and improve overall customer experience.
  - Targeted Onboarding: Millennials value personalization. Develop onboarding experiences that cater to their age group's needs. Offer financial literacy resources, budgeting tools, and goal-setting features to show immediate value.

## For Model Improvements
The model was built using most features. To potentially improve its F1 score, we can try simplifying it by removing less important features. We can also explore creating new features from the existing ones, like combining income and age into a financial maturity score. Focusing on the most important features, like income, credit score, account balance, and age, might reveal additional insights to enhance the model's performance.
